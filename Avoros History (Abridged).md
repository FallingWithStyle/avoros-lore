Avoros History - Abridged v1.01

Origin
Avoros was never meant to exist. It began as the dying spell of a cosmic being known as the Sleeper, whose body and mind fractured into matter and life. Its blood became oceans, its nerves became rivers of living energy, and its dream became the world itself.

The Living World
Avoros is alive and aware. It heals, hungers, and remembers. Forests bloom and decay overnight, mountains shift like muscles, and lightning murmurs through its veins — the echo of a forgotten heartbeat.

Motes and Shives
Motes are fragments of the planet’s bio-magical essence, drifting like luminous dust. When they cluster, they form shives — organic crystals that grow, think, or even hatch into living forms. To harvest them is to touch the planet’s nervous system.

The Dungeons
When invaders came to mine Avoros’s energy, the planet fought back through transformation. Its crust split open into living labyrinths of flesh and bone — the dungeons. These are not structures, but symptoms, the world’s immune response made manifest.

The Crawlers
What began as horror became spectacle. Corporations turned dungeon expeditions into entertainment, broadcasting the Avoros Crawler Initiative across the stars. For the locals, though, the dungeons are simply weather — part of the planet’s endless cycle of rebirth.

The Species
Six primary species inhabit Avoros and its orbit:
	•	Thalorin – plantbound children of the world.
	•	Straylen – descendants of stranded humans.
	•	Krivari – insectoid invaders turned settlers.
	•	Caelith – beings of light and vapor.
	•	Obelith – crystalline giants corrupted by life.
	•	Somnari – fragments of the Sleeper’s dream.

Symbiosis
Avoros is not good or evil. It reacts. It learns from all who touch its soil and reshapes itself around their presence. Motes gather where curiosity thrives, and shives form where conflict hardens.

Every step upon Avoros is a lesson the world remembers.
