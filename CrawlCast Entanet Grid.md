The CrawlCast Entanet Grid is the galaxy’s largest dungeon broadcast and contract exchange, linking millions of registered micro-corps across the CrawlCast Entanet Grid (CCEG).

These days, just about everybody is their own corporation. This applies to crawlers, too: a one-person enterprise chasing contracts, loot, and the elusive dream of positive quarterly returns. The CCEG handles the rest: distribution, ranking, sponsorships, and recovery notices when things go terminal.

Participation is voluntary*.

“Maximize shareholder value.”
