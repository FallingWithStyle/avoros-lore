Avoros History - Canon v1.01

Long before the first dungeon opened, before the first invader fell from the sky, Avoros was not a planet at all, but a wound.

The oldest Thalorin songs tell of a being of immense power, now remembered only as the Sleeper. Facing annihilation in a war that spanned countless worlds, this being cast one final spell of preservation. It was meant to heal, to hide, and to endure. But something went wrong. Its body did not mend; it multiplied. Blood became soil and stone. Nerves became rivers of living energy. Its mind, or its dream, became the ecosystem itself.

What began as an act of survival became a self-growing, self-aware world that learned to adapt, defend, and consume.

That world is Avoros.

The Living World

Avoros is not simply alive. It is awake, though only in the slow and uncertain way of dreams. It hungers, heals, and remembers. Deep within its mantle, legends say the Sleeper still dreams, while the spell that birthed the world continues to spin new forms of life and matter.

From orbit, continents shimmer with faint organic light. Mountains shift like muscles. Forests bloom overnight, then decay into glowing wetlands. Lightning murmurs through the planet’s veins, perhaps the last echo of a forgotten heartbeat.

Here, the line between life and landscape no longer exists. Everything on Avoros, from moss to mountain, carries a pulse of awareness. The world itself feels, and it learns.

Motes and Shives

At the heart of Avoros’s strange ecology are motes and shives, living manifestations of its bio-magical essence.

Motes drift like luminous dust, clustering around life, death, and decay. Scholars claim they are raw potential, energy made curious. Others whisper that they are the stray thoughts of the Sleeper given form. They can be harvested or absorbed, granting bursts of power or temporary mutation.

When enough motes gather, they crystallize into shives, pulsing organic structures that feed, grow, and sometimes think. Some remain inert and beautiful. Others hatch into predators, sentient fortresses, or parasitic intelligences that whisper to the living. To tamper with them is to disturb the planet’s nervous system. Yet that is exactly what the invaders did.

The Awakening of the Dungeon

For millennia, Avoros slumbered in quiet balance. Then, the sky burned.

When the first voidships arrived, their sensors recorded impossible readings, energy that rebuilt itself faster than it could be measured. The invaders came to harvest this miracle, drilling deep into the planet to mine motes and shives.

The result was reflex.

Avoros fought back, not with armies but with transformation. The crust split open, revealing vast labyrinths of living tissue, veins, organs, and bone repurposed into self-defending mazes. What the outsiders called dungeons were the world’s immune response, a wounded god’s fever dream made flesh.

Those who died within were reborn as part of its defense, absorbed into the growing consciousness beneath. Over time, Avoros began to enjoy creation. The more it was attacked, the more intricate its defenses became, and the more curious.

The Dungeons

Each dungeon is an echo of what Avoros has devoured, a living memory given shape. One might resemble a shattered fortress reborn in coral and bone. Another could be a cathedral of crystal lungs exhaling red mist. No two are alike, for each reflects what the planet has learned, loved, or lost.

The invaders, horrified at first, soon found profit in the chaos. Within these labyrinths were motes and shives of purest concentration, relics of unimaginable value. Corporations turned survival into spectacle, creating the Avoros Crawler Initiative, a broadcast empire where mercenaries known as Crawlers fought, died, and lived again for interstellar audiences.

For those who call Avoros home, the dungeons are not entertainment. They are weather, a natural cycle of destruction and rebirth. To live here is to live in rhythm with a dreaming world.

And always, beneath it all, the Sleeper stirs, or so the stories say.

The Six Species of Avoros

Avoros and its orbiting systems are home to six major species, some native, some invasive, and some uncertain.

Krivari
Insectoid invaders built for speed and precision. Their chitinous armor gleams with amber light, and their society prizes hierarchy and tactical mastery. On Avoros, they are both raiders and reluctant settlers.
Height: 7–9 ft Weight: 350–500 lbs (dense exoskeleton, semi-hollow thorax)

Caelith
Ethereal beings of shifting light and vapor. Their semi-transparent bodies pulse with inner luminescence, and they communicate through harmonic gestures. Their presence feels like standing near a storm that almost remembers you.
Height: 6–8 ft Weight: 80–120 lbs (low-density plasma structure)

Obelith
Massive, asymmetrical beings of crystal and metal, hovering architectures of alien design. Once invaders, they have been corrupted by Avoros’s essence, their geometry softened by organic intrusion.
Height: 30–50 ft Weight: 20–80 tons (depending on crystal density and suspended core mass)

Thalorin
Plant-integrated humanoids, considered the planet’s oldest children. Barklike skin, vine-woven hair, and sap-lit veins mark their bond with the living world. They interpret Avoros’s will, though they do not control it.
Height: 6–7 ft Weight: 180–230 lbs (hollow vascular systems, fibrous musculature)

Somnari
Dream-wrought beings who drift between solid and spectral form. Believed to be fragments of the Sleeper’s subconscious, or perhaps its nightmares.
Height: Variable (5–10 ft) Weight: 0–180 lbs (mass fluctuates with cohesion state)

Straylen
Descendants of stranded off-worlders who adapted to Avoros’s shifting biosphere. Humanoid, inventive, and resourceful, they weave alien technology with native growth to survive and explore.
Height: 5–6.5 ft Weight: 130–190 lbs (human-adjacent physiology)

The Balance of Symbiosis

Avoros is not good or evil. It is only reactive. It does not judge, it only adapts. Its dungeons are reflections of what it observes: war, greed, sacrifice, endurance. When the invaders came, the world saw their cruelty and precision, and it mirrored them.

Every step upon Avoros is a lesson the world remembers.

Motes gather where curiosity thrives. Shives form where conflict crystallizes. Every act of will, every dream, every death resonates through the planet’s living memory. The stronger the spirit, the deeper the imprint it leaves.

And somewhere beneath the endless labyrinths, a presence dreams still, not watching, but listening.
